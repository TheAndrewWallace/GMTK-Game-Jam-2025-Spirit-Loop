# GMTK Game Jam 2025 - Spirit Loop
For the GMTK Game Jam, particiapants had 4 days to create a video game based on the theme "Loop". This repository contains my submission for the event. I undertook this game jam for fun and as a learning experience!

My idea for the jam was to make a platformer in Unity where the player could reverse time and leave behind a spirit that would "loop" through their past reversed actions, which could then be used to solve puzzles. The time mechanics where created simply using a circular array at set recording intervals, and then moving between these intervals to interpret the position between indexed frames. The ghost followed the same technique in reverse. The main challenge of this project was in creaating the character models and animations. You can play the game here: https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2025/rate/3777268
